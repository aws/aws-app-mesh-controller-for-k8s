## AWS App Mesh Controller For K8s

AWS App Mesh Controller For K8s is a controller to help manage AppMesh resources for a Kubernetes cluster.  The controller watches custom resources for changes and reflects those changes into the App Mesh API. It is accompanied by the deployment of three custom resource definitions ([CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)): meshes, virtualnodes, and virtualservices.  These map to App Mesh API objects which the controller manages for you. 

## Getting started

Check out the [example](docs/example.md) application, and read the [design](docs/design.md).

To begin using it in your cluster, follow the [install instructions](docs/install.md).

## Custom Resource Examples

First, create a Mesh resource, which will trigger the controller to create a Mesh via the App Mesh API.  Then, define VirtualServices for each application that you want to route traffic to, and finally create VirtualNodes for each Deployment that will make up that Application.

### Mesh

    apiVersion: appmesh.k8s.aws/v1beta1
    kind: Mesh
    metadata:
      name: my-mesh

### Virtual Node

    apiVersion: appmesh.k8s.aws/v1beta1
    kind: VirtualNode
    metadata:
      name: my-app-a
      namespace: prod
    spec:
      meshName: my-mesh
      listeners:
        - portMapping:
            port: 9000
            protocol: http
      serviceDiscovery:
        dns:
          hostName: my-app-a.prod.svc.cluster.local
      backends:
        - virtualService:
            virtualServiceName: my-svc-a

### Virtual Service

    apiVersion: appmesh.k8s.aws/v1beta1
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: my-svc-a
      namespace: prod
    spec:
      meshName: my-mesh
      virtualRouter:
        listeners:
          - portMapping:
              port: 9000
              protocol: http
      routes:
        - name: route-to-svc-a
          http:
            match:
              prefix: /
            action:
              weightedTargets:
                - virtualNodeName: 
                  weight: 1
