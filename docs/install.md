## Install

Although the controller can be used independently from the aws-app-mesh-inject webhook, it is recommended that they be used together.  To Install the webhook, execute the following commands:

```bash
# use `export MESH_NAME=color-mesh` to work with the example in this repository.
export MESH_NAME="<my-mesh-name>"
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-inject/v0.1.5/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This will launch the webhook into the appmesh-inject namespace. Now add the correct permissions to your worker nodes (or your pod identity solution, like kube2iam):

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "appmesh:DescribeMesh",
                    "appmesh:DescribeVirtualNode",
                    "appmesh:DescribeVirtualService",
                    "appmesh:DescribeVirtualRouter",
                    "appmesh:DescribeRoute",
                    "appmesh:CreateMesh",
                    "appmesh:CreateVirtualNode",
                    "appmesh:CreateVirtualService",
                    "appmesh:CreateVirtualRouter",
                    "appmesh:CreateRoute",
                    "appmesh:UpdateMesh",
                    "appmesh:UpdateVirtualNode",
                    "appmesh:UpdateVirtualService",
                    "appmesh:UpdateVirtualRouter",
                    "appmesh:UpdateRoute",
                    "appmesh:ListMeshes",
                    "appmesh:ListVirtualNodes",
                    "appmesh:ListVirtualServices",
                    "appmesh:ListVirtualRouters",
                    "appmesh:ListRoutes",
                    "appmesh:DeleteMesh",
                    "appmesh:DeleteVirtualNode",
                    "appmesh:DeleteVirtualService",
                    "appmesh:DeleteVirtualRouter",
                    "appmesh:DeleteRoute"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }

Next, launch the controller:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-controller-for-k8s/v0.1.2/deploy/all.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Make sure it's ready:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment app-mesh-controller -n appmesh-system
```

Now try following along with [the example](example.md) to get a feel for how it works!
